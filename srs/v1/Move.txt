Move


// brief description
=====================

This is the abstract base class that all the moves in the game inherit from. All the moves will be executed by the Dealer class. 
There are 2 primary types of moves in Kitz, "ask for a card" move and "drop a kit" move. Each of these types can fall into 2 categories.
They are "raw" moves, meaning the move object is created but its action is not been executed yet, and "executed" moves, meaning the opposite.


// requirements
================

1) Must have a unique id for each move. 

2) Timestamps for object creation time and executed time. ( might come in handy, who knows :D )

3) Hold all the details of the move necessary for the dealer to execute the move. ( Ex: which player initiated the move etc. )

4) A way to know what type of a move it is.

5) A way to determine if the move is executed or not.
