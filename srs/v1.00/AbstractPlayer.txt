AbstractPlayer


// brief description
=====================

This is the base Player class. Both HumanPlayer, AIPlayer and anyother Player classes inherit from this.
Handles the basic house-keeping work related to Players. 


// requirements
================

1) Must have a mechanism to keep and manage the dealt cards.

2) Must have a way to select the next move of the player. ( Implementation may differ from one player to another )

3) Must have sprites for drawing purposes.

4) Must know if the player can be selected.

5) Must have bounding geometry for player selection and other input based events.

6) Must have a mechanism to process user input. ( Mouse clicks, touch events etc. )

7) Must keep the history of moves made by the player.

8) Must be able to draw itself.

9) Must have a mechanism to check whether a given input is within the bounds of the player.


// attributes < justification (optional) >
==================================================

protected Hand oHand;						< requirement (1); Hand class will manage and hold all the cards dealt to the player;
												For now, all the attributes are protected, consider if they should be private; >
										
protected ArrayList< Move > aoMoveHistory; 	< requirement (6); libgdx have an Array class which might be better than this, consider replacing; >

protected Texture oPlayerSprite;			< requirement (3); >

protected bool bIsSelectable;				< requirement (4); >

protected Rectangle oBoundingBox;			< requirement (5); A rectangle is used for ease and efficiency; >



// methods < justification (optional) >
===============================================

* certain getters and setters are implied.

public abstract Move getNextMove();				< requirement (2); The abstract method should be implemented by each concrete subclass; >

public boolean isWithinBounds(int iX, int iY);	< requirement (9); >

public void draw();								< requirement (8); depends on the graphics rendering 
													mechanism, check before implimentation >
													
													
*** Input handling is not cosvered in this version of the description. It is yet to be determined. Check later version of the doc.
