// attributes < justification (optional) >
==================================================

** For now, all the attributes are protected, consider if they should be private

protected Hand oHand;						< requirement (1); Hand class will manage and hold all the cards dealt to the player; >
										
protected ArrayList< Move > aoMoveHistory; 	< requirement (6); libgdx have an Array class which might be better than this, consider replacing; >

protected Texture oPlayerSprite;			< requirement (3); >

protected bool bIsSelectable;				< requirement (4); >

protected Rectangle oBoundingBox;			< requirement (5); A rectangle is used for ease and efficiency; >

protected Move oNextMove;					< requirements (2) and (10); >


// methods < justification (optional) >
===============================================

* certain getters and setters are implied.

public abstract Move getNextMove();				< requirement (2); The abstract method should be implemented by each concrete subclass; 
													Must set oNextMove; >

public boolean isWithinBounds(int iX, int iY);	< requirement (9); >

public void draw();								< requirement (8); depends on the graphics rendering 
													mechanism, check before implimentation >
													
public boolean execute();						< requirement (10); Must be preceeded by getNextMove(); oNextMove will be executed; >
													
													
*** Input handling is not cosvered in this version of the description. It is yet to be determined. Check later version of the doc.
